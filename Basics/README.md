## Basics

Part I of this book teaches you the basic concepts
you’ll need to write Python programs. Many of
these concepts are common to all programming
languages, so they’ll be useful throughout your life
as a programmer.

## Chapter 1.

you’ll install Python on your computer and run your first
program, which prints the message Hello world! to the screen.

## Chapter 2.

    you’ll learn to store information in variables and work
    with text and numerical values.

## Chapters 3 and 4.

    introduce lists. Lists can store as much information
    as you want in one variable, allowing you to work with that data efficiently.
    You’ll be able to work with hundreds, thousands, and even millions of values
    in just a few lines of code.

## Chapter 5.

you’ll use if statements to write code that responds one
way if certain conditions are true, and responds in a different way if those
conditions are not true.

## Chapter 6.

shows you how to use Python’s dictionaries, which let you
make connections between different pieces of information. Like lists, dictionaries can contain as much information as you need to store.

## Chapter 7.

you’ll learn how to accept input from users to make your
programs interactive. You’ll also learn about while loops, which run blocks
of code repeatedly as long as certain conditions remain true.

## Chapter 8.

you’ll write functions, which are named blocks of code
that perform a specific task and can be run whenever you need them.
2 Part I

## Chapter 9.

introduces classes, which allow you to model real-world
objects, such as dogs, cats, people, cars, rockets, and much more, so your
code can represent anything real or abstract.

## Chapter 10.

     shows you how to work with files and handle errors so your
    programs won’t crash unexpectedly. You’ll store data before your program
    closes, and read the data back in when the program runs again. You’ll learn
    about Python’s exceptions, which allow you to anticipate errors, and make
    your programs handle those errors gracefully.

## Chapter 11.

you’ll learn to write tests for your code to check that
your programs work the way you intend them to. As a result, you’ll be able
to expand your programs without worrying about introducing new bugs.
Testing your code is one of the first skills that will help you transition from
beginner to intermediate program
